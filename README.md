A fun project focusing on the Distractibles podcast crew - Mark, Bob, and Wade. The goal is to perform a general analysis of comment feedback from their YouTube videos. Utilizing an API to retrieve comments, transforming them into a DataFrame for data exploration, sentiment analysis, and potential text classification to gauge audience preferences among the three.

I took inspiration from Ken Jee's Get_Cleaned_Youtube_Comments Python Script when extracting the youtube comments.
